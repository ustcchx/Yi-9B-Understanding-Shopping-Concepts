I lost some weight and needed a smaller size purchased on Amazon for convenience. I do not know the the quality of the material used has decreased or if these just have a healing hand label. These scrubs are pretty terrible. I only kept the 3 pairs because I need to wear something. All 3 are the same brand, style and size yet the purple pants are very tight compared to the grey and navy. The material on all of them is just bad. They catch every single piece of lint and are already getting those balls you see on an old sweater and I have worn these twice.

Its very comfortable but slips very easily. You also need to put loctite on the screw or it comes loose during use. And you have to remember to clean it! Because of the type of steel it is, it will rust if you let it. I sunk mine in a water soaked log over night and when I woke up the next day the exposed blade had rust on it. Stupid me. Now the good stuff... its an awesome chopper. This has replaced my hatchet. The type of steel also allows it to maintain a good edge. Its obviously a large size so small camp tasks are not suited to it. But it is possible with a steady careful hand.

I have a really high arch and most shoes don\u2019t provide proper support for me. This soft flexible material pushes upwards into your arch with every step! You can feel the support! LOVE them and the color choices!  I found these 3 years ago and have been telling everyone I know about them. I wear these daily in doors and out!

I lost some weight and needed a smaller size purchased on Amazon for convenience. I do not know the the quality of the material used has decreased or if these just have a healing hand label. These scrubs are pretty terrible. I only kept the 3 pairs because I need to wear something. All 3 are the same brand, style and size yet the purple pants are very tight compared to the grey and navy. The material on all of them is just bad. They catch every single piece of lint and are already getting those balls you see on an old sweater and I have worn these twice.

But since the only options were small medium and large, and after reading the reviews, I went with a medium.  It is way way too big.  I should have gone with a small or XS.  So I am disappointed because she is going to wear it for pictures.  Instead of sending it back, I'll just have to cut and sew it myself. The colors are really bright and it's a pretty nice shirt.

Its very comfortable but slips very easily. You also need to put loctite on the screw or it comes loose during use. And you have to remember to clean it! Because of the type of steel it is, it will rust if you let it. I sunk mine in a water soaked log over night and when I woke up the next day the exposed blade had rust on it. Stupid me. Now the good stuff... its an awesome chopper. This has replaced my hatchet. The type of steel also allows it to maintain a good edge. Its obviously a large size so small camp tasks are not suited to it. But it is possible with a steady careful hand. Over all I really love the knife and it goes every where my backpack goes.\nAspect List: \n1.safety\n2.quality\n3.appearance\n4.ease of use\n5.ease of use\n6.length\n7.elasticity\n8.rust\n9.blade play\n10.grip\nOutput: : ",
